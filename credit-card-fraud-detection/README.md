## 🛡️Credit Card Fruad Detection
This project aims to build a **Credit Card Fraud Detection** system that uses machine learning algorithms to classify transactions as *fraudulent* or *legitimate*. It’s developed using Python and industry-standard libraries, focusing on efficient preprocessing, data visualization, and model training.

Anyone joining the project should be able to understand the data pipeline, replicate the results and modify the model architecture for experimentation.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python 3.11** – programming language  
- **Pandas** – data analysis and manipulation  
- **NumPy** – mathematical operations  
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning model training and evaluation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive development and documentation

## ⚙️ Features
- Data preprocessing pipeline (handling imbalanced datasets using sampling techniques)  
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization  
- Model training using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees  
- Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC Curve)  
- Real-time transaction simulation (for testing purposes)  
- Modular structure for easy experimentation with different ML models

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts (Jupyter)
For anyone working in the notebook environment:

| Shortcut | Action |
|-----------|---------|
| **Shift + Enter** | Run a cell |
| **Ctrl + Enter** | Run a cell without moving to the next |
| **A / B** | Add cell above/below |
| **M / Y** | Switch between Markdown and Code mode |
| **Ctrl + S** | Save checkpoint |

These help navigate and document efficiently while analyzing code.

## 🔍 The Process

1. **Data Collection:** Loaded the Kaggle credit card fraud dataset containing anonymized transaction data.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Checked for missing values, normalized features, separated legitimate and fraudulent transactions.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized distributions and correlations using Seaborn/Matplotlib.  
4. **Model Training:** Built several ML models using Scikit-learn and tuned hyperparameters for accuracy.  
5. **Model Evaluation:** Compared models using confusion matrix, ROC curve, and classification report.  
6. **Deployment Stage (optional):** Prepared model export for potential integration with web or cloud services.

## 🧩 What I Learnt
- Handling **imbalanced datasets** effectively using under-sampling and over-sampling techniques (SMOTE).  
- Understanding **model performance trade-offs** (precision vs recall) for fraud detection.  
- Using **visual analysis** for feature relationships and anomaly identification.  
- Improving data pipeline efficiency in **Jupyter workflows** and reproducible experiments.  
- Importance of documentation and modular workflow for team scalability.  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Integrate **deep learning models** (e.g., Neural Networks with TensorFlow or PyTorch).  
- Add **web interface** to visualize transactions dynamically.  
- Implement **CI/CD workflow** for model retraining and deployment using GitHub Actions or AWS.  
- Enhance **data privacy** handling and encryption tools.  
- Add **Docker support** for uniform environment setup across contributors.
